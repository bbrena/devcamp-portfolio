                    I have some experience in coding. I know HTML, CSS, SCSS, Ruby on Rails,
                  Ruby, BootStrap, Devise and the command line. I can work in the terminal
                  and in Sublime Text. This website was created from scratch with my knowledge.
                  I have taken Code To Success and I have an account on CodeCademy. I also have
                  accounts on PluralSight and Cloud 9. I have created my own RubyGem and published
                  it to RubyGems.org. I like coding and programming because there is always something
                  new to learn and it encourages me to use problem solving skills.

                    Allow me to introduce myself. I am Brena A. I grew up with a very 
                  happy family of my mother, father, me, and my brother. I lived in a 
                  small house with a giant cherry tree. I loved the shade of that tree
                  and jumping on the trampoline under it and picking the cherries. My
                  dog was the best dog that ever lived. It was wonderful. I was 
                  devastated when my parents told me we were moving. We moved a small
                  distance, but I still miss that house very much. I learned to like
                  the house I live in now. Eventually, though, a new person arrived in
                  our family and disrupted the peacefulness. He was my great uncle.
                  We've had him for almost 4 years, but he was about 38 when his mother
                  died and we started caring for him because he was disabled. Ever since
                  then, my family was different. My brother, who has Diabetes and
                  Down Syndrome, acted more like him, which is getting to the point where
                  it is just down right wrong. Family issues have built up tension, and
                  now I think the only person who is truly happy in our family is him.
                  We are all either sad, slightly happy, or angry. It is just something
                  so complex and horrible that it can't be described in words. We are
                  still holding strong, though. My dad started his own business, and
                  my mom got a job. We are about to move again, but this time far away.
                  I don't think I will miss here too much after what's happened.

                    Obviously, one of my hobbies is coding and programming, but I also like to
                  bead and make jewelry, read books, play puzzle games, and just enjoy school.
                  I like to make jewelry, because I can use my hands for fine motor skills and
                  it makes something beautiful that someone can use. I enjoy reading books,
                  because it takes me away from the world, into somewhere I can just relax.
                  I play puzzle games because I find it is challenging and fun at the same
                  time. You complete one puzzle, and move on to the next and test your brain.
                  Lastly, I am fond of school because it simply gives you knowledge that
                  you will use later in life. My favorite subject is math, then science, 
                  history, and English. Most kids think school is the most boring thing, and 
                  is a waste of time, but I see it differently. It is somewhere to learn new
                  things and work hard.
